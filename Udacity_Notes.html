    <h2>Lesson 1:  The Basics of the Web and HTML</h2>

    <div>
      <p>
      <b><u>World Wide Web</u></b>
      </p>
      <p>
        The web is simply a vast number of computers
        that communicate with each other using <em>HTTP</em> or <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">Hypertext Transfer Protocol</a>.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p>
      <b><u>HTML</u></b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>HTML</em> stand for <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">Hypertext Markup Language</a>.
        A majority of the content on the World Wide Web is made up of <em>HTML</em> documents.  These documents
        can contain text, images, videos, etc. The text in a <em>HTML</em> document defines what the user sees and the
        <b>markup</b> defines how the content appears and is arranged.
      </p>

        <b><u>Tags and Elements</u></b>
      </p>
      <p>
        HTML documents consist of elements.  HTML tags tell the browser the type of element.
        Elements are either <em>Inline</em> or <em>Block</em>. From the W3Schools <a href = "https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_blocks.asp">reference</a>:
        an inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary; while a block-level element always starts on a
        new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can)
      </p>
    </div>
   </div>
<b><u>HTML-CSS-DOM</u></b>
<br>
<p>HTML is a language (syntax & rules).  The basic building blocks of an HTML document are tags.  Tags are interpreted by the browser (using DOM)
to create elements in a tree.  An element is an opening tag + content + closing tag.  CSS is a language that defines the style for each class of element.  For example:
  all h1 elements w/ class = "article" should be red in color.</p>

<b><u>Boxes, Grids & Rules</u></b>
<p><em>Everything</em> on the web is boxes!  Boxes are easy to arrange and rearrange on a background page grid.</p>

<b><u>Boxify a Design</u></b>
<p>Start with one big box around the material.  Decompose the layout naturally with smaller and smaller subboxes.
  This will make converting to HTML simpler.  <b><em>BIG to small</em></b>.</p>
